Recursion is a poweful technique to know as a software engineer.
Basiccly a recusrion is a function that calls it self until it hits our basecase, otherwise it will keep in stuck in a infinite loop.
It maybe returrns a value ore i doesent.
Thats why we need our condition on some parameter such theat when we hit some condition at some point we will stop the recursion.

```ts
const countToTen = (n: number): number => {
  if (n === 10) return n // Basecase, otherwise we will never stop running the function.
  console.log(n) // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  return countToTen(n + 1) // receive call
}

console.log(countToTen(0))
```

Have you seen the movie Inception where they go into other peoples dreams, they could go infinite amount of levels deep, and to know they are still in a dream they have their token that tells them if they are kept in the dream or not.
The token is the base case, it will help us to not keep going deeper until we loose the control and never can wake up from the dream.

## Recursions are lazy

## Why ore why not use recursion?
